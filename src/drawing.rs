/// Context for JSFormat Extrude
///
/// I'm having second thoughts about SarzakModel, over in sarzak. Are we running
/// code generation on each part separately? Should we mash them together? Giving
/// this just a little thought, I think it makes sens to treat them exactly as
/// separate domains. So that means we need to invent imported entities at the
/// data level, even if they don't exist in the tool. BTW, I'm stoned as fuck.

/// So separate domains. I thought about this a few days ago. Since we are pointing
/// into sarzak, we are the ones that need to store the pointer. It's funny, this
/// is _exactly_ the stuff I've been thinking about. This is over the top maybe,
/// but what if I create a model for how this works and do codegen? ü§£ü§£ü§£
///
/// So, anyway, the context contains the sarzak domain. We can do id lookups and
/// all that good shit. I didn't plan it, it just seems to work out this way. And
/// for every time it works this way, there's a dozen dead ends I've explored. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
///
/// Looking at Extrude, I wonder if we couldn't use a similar trait to hang our
/// compiler directives off of? Like pass a context around with the instances? I'd
/// have to think on that. Maybe on my walk.
///
/// I realized that each domain needs its own object store. Duh. Some part of me
/// was hoping that all the work I've done would somehow translate. It will
/// eventually. But how? I need to generate the object stores. I need to generate
/// all of this handwritten library code. Not all of it. But from this point
/// forward, unless there's a more general abstraction.
///
/// Think this out. I have generated code in this project. I used the sarzak domain
/// to do that. This is the drawing domain. So I have a head start on sarzak. The
/// implementation of this domain is in terms of sarzak. So this is actually
/// already using all my hard work. Once this domain is done, we'll be able to
/// generate code for both domains. How do those domains benefit? The answer is
/// that they will be built the same way, but with more code generated, or coming
/// from the user. Which is to say generated.
///
/// I need to reorganize model/drawing. drawing should contain all of the From and
/// Extrude implementations. That reminds me, the From impls need to be in the same
/// file as the generated code. So, I can either copy and paste all of the impls
/// into the code generation script. Or, what?
